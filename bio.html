            <p class="column column bio">My name is Rich Coleman and I currently live in Chicago, Illinois, working
                as an Ad Ops
                Manager at Upshot Agency. I've been working in the Ad Ops field since 2015 and find the technology
                behind digital advertising quite fascinating. Because of this I also enjoy freelancing for smaller
                agencies to help them with their technical needs, whether it be figuring out the best way to tag a
                client's site or establishing best practices for digital ad trafficking and ad server management.
                <br><br>

                I'm originally from Philadelphia, PA, and graduated in 2010 from The Pennsylvania State University with
                a Bachelor's in Journalism. I am currently back in school learning full stack web development at
                Northwestern University. If you'd like to see what I've been up to, check out my portfolio!</p>
